# Provider runtime

Provider adapters receive one already frozen prompt and return one canonical
review. They do not collect Git content, retry, select another model, render a
report, or mutate the reviewed repository.

## Shared process boundary

The runtime resolves each executable to a regular executable outside the
reviewed repository. Provider commands are argument arrays executed directly;
repository material is sent only on standard input.

Every process runs in its own process group with a fixed timeout, cancellation,
and bounded stdout and stderr. Timeout or cancellation kills the complete group.
Diagnostics redact credential-bearing environment values, escape terminal
control characters, and remain bounded.

## Codex CLI

The Codex adapter currently requires these observed CLI surfaces:

- top level: `--ask-for-approval`, plus `--strict-config` in strict mode and
  `--search` when web access is enabled;
- `exec`: `--ephemeral`, `--skip-git-repo-check`, `--output-schema`,
  `--output-last-message`, `--json`, and `--cd`;
- strict `exec`: `--ignore-user-config`, `--ignore-rules`, and `--sandbox`.

Before model invocation, the adapter checks `--version`, both help surfaces,
and `login status` when neither `CODEX_API_KEY` nor `OPENAI_API_KEY` is present. Capability,
authentication, timeout, cancellation, provider-process, and protocol failures
remain distinct.

The adapter always passes an explicit model so result metadata is exact. An
empty model setting resolves to `gpt-5.6-sol`; there is no model fallback.
Web access is explicitly disabled unless enabled by trusted configuration.

| Mode | Provider state | Codex controls |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `strict` | Empty home, XDG, and Codex directories; selected provider credential only | Read-only sandbox, ignored user config/rules, disabled hooks/plugins/skills/multi-agent, fixed shell environment |
| `native` | Existing provider environment and authentication | User Codex configuration is preserved; review still runs in an empty temporary workspace |

Codex structured outputs support a smaller JSON Schema vocabulary than the
canonical local validator. Generation therefore uses a projection that omits
the unsupported `not` path rule. The returned last-message file and JSONL agent
message must agree byte-for-byte after surrounding whitespace, and the result
is then decoded against the complete canonical Go contract. A projection never
makes an invalid result acceptable.

## Verification

Default tests use controlled fake executables and never invoke a model. The
authenticated opt-in smoke is:

```bash
AUTOREVIEW_TEST_LIVE_CODEX=1 go test ./internal/provider -run '^TestCodexLive$' -count=1 -v
```

CLI target collection, retries, final report construction, output rendering,
and exit codes belong to the orchestration milestone in issue #8.
