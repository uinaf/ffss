# autoreview

`autoreview` is a Go CLI and agent skill for structured, independent code
review through Codex CLI, Claude Code, or Cursor Agent.

The project is under active development toward `v0.1.0`. The first proven
release will support local Git targets, frozen and secret-scanned review
bundles, strict result validation, terminal and JSON reports, and a standalone
Tessl skill. CI reporting, signed binary releases, and Homebrew distribution
will follow after the local package is proven.

## Development

Build and inspect the bootstrap CLI:

```bash
go build ./cmd/autoreview
./autoreview --version
```

Run the current verification suite:

```bash
mise run verify
```
