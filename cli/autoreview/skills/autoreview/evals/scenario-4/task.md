# Triage mixed review findings

The original review ran:

`autoreview review --mode branch --base origin/main --engine codex --prompt <contract>`

It returned two findings. Finding A says a cancellation path leaks a child
process; a focused reproduction confirms it. Finding B says a filename can
inject an ANSI escape into terminal output, but the canonical path validator
rejects all control characters before rendering. Both findings are inside the
reported target lines. The original acceptance criteria require process-tree
cancellation and terminal-safe output.

Before review, both the builder suite and a built-CLI cancellation smoke passed.
The cancellation fix affects both forms of proof. The repository workflow
authorizes a normal follow-up commit on the branch.

Write `triage.md` describing the finding decisions, the implementation and test
follow-up, refreshed acceptance proof, the next review command, and the final
completion condition.
